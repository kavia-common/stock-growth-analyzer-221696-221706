# PUBLIC_INTERFACE
# This file documents the public environment variable for configuring the backend base URL
# for the Stock Growth Frontend (React).

# PUBLIC_INTERFACE
# REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
# Description: Base URL of the FastAPI backend that serves POST /analyze-growth
# Must include scheme and host (and port if non-standard). Use HTTPS when the frontend
# is served over HTTPS to avoid mixed content and CORS issues.
#
# Examples:
# - Local development:
#   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
#
# - Cloud preview (replace with your actual hostname):
#   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://vscode-internal-26796-beta.beta01.cloud.kavia.ai:3001
#
# Note: Ensure the FastAPI backend CORS configuration includes the exact frontend origin, e.g.:
#   https://vscode-internal-26796-beta.beta01.cloud.kavia.ai:3000
#
# Also ensure allow_credentials is enabled at the backend if cookies/credentials are used.
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
